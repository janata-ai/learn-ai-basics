# 📘 Learn AI Basics – Hands-On Learning with Python & Colab

Welcome to the **Learn AI Basics** repository by [Janata AI](https://github.com/janataai) – your starting point for mastering Artificial Intelligence with a practical, hands-on approach.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to brush up on your foundations, this repo will help you understand how AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) actually work – **with real code, real data, and real-world examples**.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn
- Fundamentals of **AI, ML, and DL** in an easy-to-follow way
- How to use **Python**, **Google Colab**, and popular **ML libraries** like:
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
- End-to-end hands-on projects
- Building blocks of **LLMs, RAG**, and **AI Agents** (coming soon!)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?
- 📚 Students starting with AI/ML
- 👩‍💼 Professionals reskilling into tech roles
- 💡 Creators and freelancers exploring GenAI
- 🧠 Self-learners who love coding and discovery

No prior AI experience needed — just curiosity and commitment!
